You will need software like Vcxsvr to run the GUI if you are operating on WSL instead of native UNIX distribution.
Then you need to run the command below in the WSL console and enable Vcxsvr to give WSL the permission to pull up the GUI:
$ export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0

To compile the GUI you will need the GTK3.0 package and run the command below (and I suggest you forget about it and just run the compiled app):
$ gcc `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-3.0` -o hello hello-world-gtk.c `pkg-config --libs gtk+-3.0`

To run the GUI you will simply just call by the app name:
$ ./hello
